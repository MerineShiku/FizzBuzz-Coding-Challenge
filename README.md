# FizzBuzz-Coding-Challenge is a common interview question
Problem Statement
You need to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 such that:

If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Fizz" instead of that number.
If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Buzz" instead of that number.
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.
Try to think of a solution to solve this challenge with the help of loops and conditional statements before moving to the solution.
